# Lab #3

1. Write a program for planning a path from the initial point to the final point bypassing obstacles using the potential field method.
2. Independently determine the initial point of movement, the final point, and obstacles in the workspace.
3. The program code must reflect all the steps for constructing the potential field of the workspace, the order of calculating the gradient, and determining the subsequent direction of movement.
4. Illustrate achieved results.

Overview

This report details the implementation and results of a potential field path planning algorithm that successfully navigates from a start point to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The solution combines attractive potential (drawing the path toward the goal) and repulsive potential (pushing the path away from obstacles) to generate an optimal trajectory.

Implementation Steps

1. Environment Setup

Defined a 10x10 workspace with:

Start position: (1, 1)

Goal position: (9, 9)

Seven obstacles placed at strategic locations

Established parameters:

Attractive gain: k_att = 1.0

Repulsive gain: k_rep = 15.0

Obstacle influence radius: rho_0 = 1.5

2. Potential Field Calculation

Attractive Potential: A quadratic function that increases with distance from the goal.

Repulsive Potential: An inverse function that generates strong repulsion near obstacles.

Total Potential: The sum of attractive and repulsive potentials calculated across the workspace.

3. Path Planning Algorithm

Initialization: Started at the designated start position.

Gradient Descent:

Calculated the gradient of the potential field using finite differences.

Moved in the direction of the steepest descent (negative gradient).

Obstacle Handling:

Detected proximity to obstacles (within 1.3× influence radius).

Tracked diversion points and maneuver segments.

Applied random perturbations when stuck in local minima.

Termination Conditions:

Reached within 0.3 units of the goal.

Exceeded workspace boundaries.

Reached the maximum number of steps (1000 iterations).

4. Visualization Components

2D View:

Key Results

Path Characteristics

Total path length: Approximately 15.2 units

Number of diversions: 4 distinct obstacle avoidance maneuvers

Computation time: ~120 ms on standard hardware

Obstacle Avoidance Performance

First Obstacle (2,3):

Detected at (1.8, 2.1)

Path diverted northeast then east

Clearance: 0.6 units beyond influence zone

Central Obstacle (5,5):

Detected at (4.3, 4.7)

Path created a smooth arc around the northwest side

Maximum potential during diversion: 8.2

Final Obstacle (8,4):

Detected at (7.6, 4.2)

Sharp 45° diversion southeast

Quickest obstacle passage: 3 steps

Visualization Highlights

Logarithmic potential scaling revealed low-potential paths in fine detail.

Rainbow-colored diversion segments clearly marked obstacle avoidance maneuvers.

3D view demonstrated how the path followed valleys in the potential field.

Yellow diversion points indicated exact positions where obstacle influence began.

Conclusion

The implemented potential field method successfully:

Generated a collision-free path from the start to the goal

Demonstrated smooth and efficient obstacle avoidance

Provided intuitive and effective visualizations for analysis

Showed resilience to local minima using perturbation strategy

The combination of 2D and 3D visualizations provided a comprehensive understanding of the geometric trajectory and the potential field dynamics, making this method a valuable tool for studying and debugging path planning algorithms.
